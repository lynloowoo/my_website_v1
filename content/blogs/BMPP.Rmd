# Executive Summary
1. We clean the data, majorly involves exploring out-liners, filtering unsuitable cases, and simplified some variables.
2. We map put spot of hotels and color them by amount, green for lower the median and blue for higher than median to see the distribution.
3. We using a series of models to determine the real situation. And we successfully use the exhaustive method to find the `modelx` with significant variables, highest adjr2, and good predicting power.
4. In all, we are able to use what we learned to discover the story, which is the most exciting part.
5. Our key findings are as above:
  


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/XLMJX/Documents/FDSM/LBS/LBS-course/R/updated_on_8_Oct/ca09.mfa2022/website/my_website_v1/static/img/blogs/key findings.jpg", error = FALSE)
