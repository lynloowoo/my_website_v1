This is my best memory. Students cheered for that final and fatal exam and paper has been thrown
through windows, like a grand snow. That was the last month of my senior high school. After that, I left home, family, friends, and my childhood. Ever since, never
had I shouted out loud, yelled for the passionate and young youth, and I
became an silent adult. Something has long gone, with the flying snow, disappearing at that dark night.
(We cleaned up the whole mess eventually, which is always a tradition.)
