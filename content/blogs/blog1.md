This is my best memory. Students cheered, exam paper has been thrown through 
windows. That was the last month of my senior high school. After that, I left
home, family, friends, and my childhood. Ever since, never had I shouted out loud, 
yelled for the passionate and young youth, I became an silent adult. Something has 
long gone, with flying snow that night, disappearing at that dark night.
